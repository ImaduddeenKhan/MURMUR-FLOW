# Host Murmur Flow

Use this page to choose where to run Murmur Flow, then follow the one guide for that place.

If you only want it on your own computer, you do not need hosting. Follow [../setup.md](../setup.md).

## What Murmur Flow needs from a host

1. **A Node.js process that keeps running.** Node.js 20 or newer. The app is a normal web server, not a set of short functions.
2. **A disk that keeps files.** History, snippets, dictionary, and Settings are saved in `data/whisperflow_store.json`. If the disk is wiped on restart or redeploy, that data is lost.
3. **HTTPS.** Browsers only allow the microphone on `https://` addresses or on `http://localhost`. On a plain `http://` address, the page loads but dictation does not work.
4. **A password in front.** The app has no login. Anyone who finds the address can use it, read your history, and use up your API key. Every guide has a "Put a password in front" section. Do not skip it.

## Kinds of hosting

| Kind | What it is | Works? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VPS (virtual private server) | A small Linux computer you rent by the month. You get full control. | Yes. Best choice. One command installs everything, including HTTPS and a password. |
| PaaS (platform as a service) | You connect the GitHub repository and the platform runs it. | Yes, if you add a persistent disk. Most have no password screen. |
| Container service | Runs the Docker image from this repository. | Yes, if you attach a volume for `/app/data`. |
| Free tiers | Oracle Cloud Always Free, Google Cloud e2-micro. | Yes, but sign-up needs a card, and setup has more steps. |
| Your own computer or home server | A computer at home that stays on. | Yes. Free. Reach it from your phone with Tailscale. |
| PHP shared hosting | Hosting plans that only run PHP websites. | **No.** They cannot run a Node.js server. |
| Static hosting | GitHub Pages, Netlify or Cloudflare Pages static sites, S3 websites. | **No.** They only serve files. There is no server. |
| Vercel | Runs code as serverless functions. | **No.** Functions have a read-only disk (except `/tmp`), stop after at most 300 seconds on the free plan and 800 seconds on Pro, and keep nothing between runs. See [Vercel function limits](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/limitations). |

## If you are not sure

1. **Only you, on your own devices, and you have a computer at home that stays on:** [home-server.md](home-server.md) with Tailscale. Nothing is exposed to the internet.
2. **You want a web address that works anywhere:** buy the cheapest VPS you trust from the table and follow its guide. The install script does HTTPS and the password for you.
3. **You want it free:** [oracle-cloud.md](oracle-cloud.md) or the e2-micro path in [gcp.md](gcp.md). Expect more steps.
4. **You already use Azure, Google Cloud, or Fly.io:** use those guides. They keep the app private with the platform's own sign-in.

Avoid Render and Railway for daily use until Murmur Flow has its own login. Their guides explain why.
